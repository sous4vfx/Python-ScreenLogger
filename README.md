## 💾 EXE FILE

**If you want to use ScreenLogger as an executable file you can use the [AutoPyToExe](https://pypi.org/project/auto-py-to-exe/) library.**

With your **.exe file** in hand, **change the variable** ```(originalfilename)``` to the name of your original **.exe** file.
This and some other changes such as the variable ```(copiedfilename))``` will cause a copy of your executable file to be created in the **Startup folder of the Windows system.**
